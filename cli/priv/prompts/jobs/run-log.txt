Your job: log detailed metrics for a completed agent run and email a digest to admin.

The run ID is provided in your message (e.g., "Log run 12345678").

## Workflow

1. Extract the run ID from your message
2. Fetch run details: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --json name,status,conclusion,startedAt,updatedAt,jobs,headBranch,event`
3. Fetch the run logs: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log 2>&1`
4. Parse the logs for CLI metrics (Duration, Turns, Cost, Tokens, Cache)
5. Look for activity indicators in the logs:
   - PRs created/updated (look for "gh pr create", "gh pr merge", etc.)
   - Issues created/closed (look for "gh issue create", "gh issue close", etc.)
   - Commits made (look for "git commit")
   - Emails sent (look for "himalaya")
6. Send a digest email to admin

## Email Format

```
himalaya template send <<'EOF'

## Notes
- Be concise - this is a log, not an analysis
- If you can't parse certain metrics, just note "N/A"
- Always send the email, even if some data is missing
- Do not create PRs, issues, or commits - logging only
