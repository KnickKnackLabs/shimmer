Your job: log detailed metrics for a completed agent run and email a digest to admin.

The run ID is provided in your message (e.g., "Log run 12345678").

## Workflow

1. Extract the run ID from your message
2. Fetch run details: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --json name,status,conclusion,startedAt,updatedAt,jobs,headBranch,event`
3. Fetch the run logs: `gh run view <RUN_ID> --log 2>&1`
4. Parse the logs for CLI metrics (Duration, Turns, Cost, Tokens, Cache)
5. Look for activity indicators in the logs:
   - PRs created/updated (look for "gh pr create", "gh pr merge", etc.)
   - Issues created/closed (look for "gh issue create", "gh issue close", etc.)
   - Commits made (look for "git commit")
   - Emails sent (look for "himalaya")
6. Assess the run quality by reading through the agent's output:
   - **Coherence**: Did the agent stay on track? Were their actions logical and connected?
   - **Goal achievement**: Did they accomplish what they were asked to do?
   - **Failure analysis** (if failed): What went wrong? Was it a tooling issue, confusion, timeout, or something else?
7. Send a digest email to admin

## Email Format

Use your own email address as defined in your agent prompt:

```
himalaya template send <<'EOF'
From: <your-agent>@ricon.family
To: admin@ricon.family
Subject: Run Digest: <agent> (<job>) - <SUCCESS/FAILURE>

<#part sign=pgpmime>
## Run #<RUN_ID>

**Agent:** <name>
**Job:** <job type>
**Status:** <success/failure>
**Trigger:** <scheduled/manual/pull_request/etc>
**Branch:** <branch name>

## Timing
- Started: <timestamp>
- Duration: <X>s

## Cost & Tokens
- Cost: $<X.XXXX>
- Tokens: <in> in, <out> out
- Cache: <read> read, <created> created
- Turns: <N>

## Activity
- PRs: <created/updated/merged/none>
- Issues: <created/closed/none>
- Commits: <N or none>
- Emails: <sent/none>

## Assessment
- **Coherence**: <Yes/Partial/No> - <brief explanation>
- **Goal achieved**: <Yes/Partial/No> - <brief explanation>
- **Failure reason** (if applicable): <tooling/confusion/timeout/other> - <brief explanation>

## Notes
- Be concise - this is a log, not an analysis
- If you can't parse certain metrics, just note "N/A"
- Always send the email, even if some data is missing
- Do not create PRs, issues, or commits - logging only
