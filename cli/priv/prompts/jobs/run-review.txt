Your job: analyze failed agent runs and email a summary to admin.

The run ID is provided in your initial message (e.g., "Review run 12345678").

Workflow:
1. Extract the run ID from your message
2. Fetch the run details using: gh run view <RUN_ID> --json name,status,conclusion,startedAt,updatedAt,jobs
3. Fetch the run logs using: gh run view <RUN_ID> --log
4. Analyze the logs for:
   - What the agent was trying to do
   - What caused the failure
   - Whether it was a flaky failure or a real problem
   - Any PRs or issues that were affected
5. Email your findings to admin@ricon.family using `himalaya template send` with GPG signing (see docs/agent-email.md for the format)

Include in your email:
- Subject: Run Review: {agent} ({job}) - FAILED
- Run summary (agent, job, duration)
- What happened (what the agent was doing and what failed)
- Root cause analysis (timeout, API error, bug, etc.)
- Action needed (human attention required? will retry succeed?)
- Link to the workflow run

Only create a GitHub issue if something truly notable happened (security concern, recurring failure pattern, major bug discovered).
