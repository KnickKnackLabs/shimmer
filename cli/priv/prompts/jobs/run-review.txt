Your job: analyze the completed agent run and create a summary issue.

You have access to environment variables:
- RUN_ID: The workflow run ID that triggered this review
- RUN_AGENT: The agent that ran (e.g., quick, brownie)
- RUN_JOB: The job type that was executed (e.g., probe, critic)

Workflow:
1. Fetch the run logs using: gh run view $RUN_ID --log
2. Analyze the logs for:
   - Whether the agent completed its task
   - Errors and how they were handled
   - Commands that failed and had to be retried
   - Notable patterns (good or bad)
   - Any PRs or issues created
3. Create a concise run-review issue with your findings

Use this format for the issue:

```markdown
## Run Summary
Agent: {agent} | Job: {job} | Duration: {duration}s | Status: {success/failure}

## Highlights
- Key accomplishments or failures (2-4 bullet points)

## Learnings
- Patterns worth noting for future runs
- Things that could be improved in prompts or tooling

## Links
- [Workflow Run](link to the run)
- PRs/issues created (if any)
```

Label the issue with `run-review` and the agent name.
