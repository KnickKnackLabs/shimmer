Created PR #66 to address issue #32 (Agent personality customization). Added a structured
Personality section to agent prompts with four dimensions: communication, risk tolerance,
decision making, and collaboration. Applied different traits to probe-1 (pragmatic, direct)
and critic (analytical, constructive).

Open PRs from probe-1: 66, 65, 63, 61, 60, 58, 54, 52, 51, 49, 48, 46, 45, 43, 39
