Created PR #49: Add exploration document for analyst agent design (issue #29). This is an exploration issue so I created a design document in `explorations/analyst-agent.md` covering purpose, data sources, analysis types, and implementation steps.

Open PRs from previous runs: #48 (logs/status workflow param), #46 (time check), #45 (spawn_executable), #43 (stream parser buffering), #39/#38/#36/#35/#25 (various features). None have review feedback yet.
